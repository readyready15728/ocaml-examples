# OCaml Examples
## Examples for the use of the venerable FP language

OCaml is aÂ pragmatic functional programming language that I used years ago to
make the most of a very crappy computer in rendering fractal videos. The
results were [impressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DurliwSO00g) but
that was code and a workflow I never want to show anyone because of how
unbelievably horrible and janky it was and my skills have rusted greatly since
then.

Here I will be implementing OCaml code using *most* of the best practices (I'm
perhaps lazy about a few, like unit testing) so I can research how to do
things effectively only once. I will definitely use dune as a build system,
attempt to write idiomatic code, and make use of OCaml's current standard
library and recent code from the third-party ecosystem.

So far both of my example code projects are partial answers to some of the
content from Cornell University's [CS
3110](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook). While instructor Michael R. Clarkson
seems like a nice guy, I have somewhat disregarded his injunction not to post
solutions anywhere. What I am uploading here is by no means comprehensive for
said course but I want it to beneficial both for myself and others by leaving
it as a public repository. If you are somehow here looking for a means to
cheat through said course without understanding the material at all,
definitely reconsider. If, on the other hand, you are looking for help but
still want to work through the content mentally, I can't say I haven't been in
the same position myself. I don't blame you.
