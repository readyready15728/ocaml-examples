# OCaml Examples
## Examples for the use of the venerable FP language

OCaml is aÂ pragmatic functional programming language that I used years ago to
make the most of a very crappy computer in rendering fractal videos. The
results were [impressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DurliwSO00g) but
that was code and a workflow I never want to show anyone because of how
unbelievably horrible and janky it was and my skills have rusted greatly since
then.

Here I will be implementing OCaml code trying to use best practices so I can
research how to do things effectively only once. I will definitely use dune as
a build system, attempt to write idiomatic code, and make use of OCaml's
current standard library and recent code from the third-party ecosystem.

So my example code projects largely correspond to some of the content from
Cornell University's [CS 3110](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook). While
instructor Michael R. Clarkson seems like a nice guy, I have somewhat
disregarded his injunction not to post solutions anywhere. What I am uploading
here is by no means comprehensive for said course but I want it to be
beneficial both for myself and others by leaving it as a public repository. If
you are somehow here looking for a means to cheat through said course without
understanding the material at all, definitely reconsider. If, on the other
hand, you are looking for help but still want to work through the content
mentally, I can't say I haven't been in the same position myself. I don't
blame you.

(And speaking of said course, when you see "tr", it's short for "tail
recursion".)
